## RECORDING TIPS

### Setup:
1. Clean terminal with dark theme
2. Large font (18-20pt) for readability
3. Hide desktop clutter
4. Test audio levels

### Recording Tools:
- **Screen**: OBS Studio (free) or QuickTime (Mac)

### B-Roll Ideas:
- Architecture diagrams
- Code snippets (briefly)
- Test results
- Web UI interactions
- Terminal animations

### Music:
- Use royalty-free music from YouTube Audio Library
- Keep volume low (background only)
- Upbeat but professional

### Pacing:
